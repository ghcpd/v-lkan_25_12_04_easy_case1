GitHub Copilot: I'll create a short plan, start parsing `repo_metadata.jsonl`, then group and write JSONL files into per-repo folders. I'll mark progress in the todo list before and after each major step.

Reading `repo_metadata.jsonl` to extract each record's `repo` field. I'll load the file now.

Now I'll update the todo list (mark parsing done and start grouping/writing), then create per-repo folders and write grouped `records.jsonl` files. 

Starting: *Group and write files* (2/3)

I'll create directories and write grouped JSONL files for each repo found in the input — doing this

GitHub Copilot: Now I'll create a short Python script that groups the JSONL lines by `repo` and writes `records.jsonl` into per-repo folders, then run it. 

Created [](file:///d%3A/Downloads/1/gpt-5-mini/v-lkan_25_12_04_easy_case1/group_by_repo.py)

I'll run the script in a cmd terminal to generate per-repo folders and files. 

Ran terminal command: python d:\Downloads\1\gpt-5-mini\v-lkan_25_12_04_easy_case1\group_by_repo.py

Python wasn't found in PATH; I'll implement the grouping in pure PowerShell-compatible cmd script to avoid requiring Python. I'll create a simple PowerShell script and run it with `powershell -NoProfile -Command`.

GitHub Copilot: I'll run the grouping script using the specified Python interpreter, then list and read the created `records.jsonl` files to summarize results. 

Ran terminal command: "D:\package\venv310\Scripts\python.exe" d:\Downloads\1\gpt-5-mini\v-lkan_25_12_04_easy_case1\group_by_repo.py

Running the grouping script with the specified Python interpreter (PowerShell requires using the call operator). I'll execute it and then list created repo folders.

Now I'll list the created repo folders and show counts of records in each `records.jsonl`.

I'll list the created directories under the workspace folder, then read each `records.jsonl` to count records.

Progress update: script created and executed successfully; per-repo directories were created. Next I'll mark the todo for writing completed and summarize results. 

Created 3 todos

I've grouped the records by `repo` and written per-repo JSONL files. Summary and next steps below.

**What I did**
- Parsed repo_metadata.jsonl.
- Grouped records by the `repo` field.
- Created folders named after each repo with `/` replaced by `__`.
- Wrote the grouped records into records.jsonl inside each repo folder.

**Files added**
- `group_by_repo.py` — Python script that performs grouping (left in workspace).
- group_by_repo.ps1 — PowerShell script (Windows-friendly) that performs grouping.
- Per-repo folders with records.jsonl:
  - records.jsonl
  - records.jsonl
  - records.jsonl
  - records.jsonl
  - records.jsonl
  - records.jsonl
  - records.jsonl
  - records.jsonl
  - records.jsonl

(Those folders were created under v-lkan_25_12_04_easy_case1.)

**Counts**
- Each records.jsonl contains the JSONL lines for that repo from the original file. I inspected the created files; each repo above has one record in this metadata file (the original file contained one record per listed repo).

**Commands I ran**
- Created scripts:
  - `group_by_repo.py`
  - group_by_repo.ps1
- Executed grouping using the Python interpreter you requested:
  - In PowerShell:
    ```powershell
    & "D:\package\venv310\Scripts\python.exe" "d:\Downloads\1\gpt-5-mini\v-lkan_25_12_04_easy_case1\group_by_repo.py"
    ```
  - (If Python wasn't available, group_by_repo.ps1 can be run via PowerShell:
    ```powershell
    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "d:\Downloads\1\gpt-5-mini\v-lkan_25_12_04_easy_case1\group_by_repo.ps1"
    ```)

**Where to find outputs**
- The per-repo folders live here:
  - `d:\Downloads\1\gpt-5-mini\v-lkan_25_12_04_easy_case1\<repo_name_with__>/records.jsonl`

**Next steps (optional)**
- If you want, I can:
  - Remove the helper scripts after you confirm.
  - Combine the per-repo files into a zip for download.
  - Print the exact counts (I inspected and found one record per listed repo; I can produce a precise listing file if you want).
  - Modify the script to split multiple records per repo into multiple numbered files if needed.

Would you like me to zip the per-repo folders or produce a file listing with exact counts and file paths?
